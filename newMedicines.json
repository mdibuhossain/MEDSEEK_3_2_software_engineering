Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate.

Titrate above 400 mcg by 200 mcg increments bearing in mind using more than 4 tablets simultaneously has not been studied and it is important to minimize the number of strengths available to patients at any time to prevent confusion and possible overdose.

Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

  "pharmacology": "It is a combination of an antibacterial, an antifungal, an anti-inflammatory and a topical local anesthetic agent. This ear drop has been specially formulated to maintain the natural environment of the external ear canal. Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that has a broad spectrum of activity against otic pathogens without ototoxicity. Hence Ofloxacin is preferred to Aminoglycosides for any application within the middle ear space. Ofloxacin exerts antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase of bacteria. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against the following organisms responsible for otic infections: Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clotrimazole is a synthetic imidazole derivative, which is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that exerts fungicidal activity against fungi responsible for superficial mycotic infections affecting the outer or middle ear including Candida, Microsporum & Trichophyton. Clotrimazole inhibits Cytochrome P-450 synthesis of Ergosterol, which decreases fungal cell wall integrity thus inhibits fungal growth. Clotrimazole also has activity against certain bacteria such as Streptococci and Staphylococci. The antibacterial effect of Clotrimazole is advantageous to treat mixed bacterial-fungal infections. Beclomethasone Dipropionate is a potent steroid as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Beclomethasone like other topical corticosteroids, has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. It induces phospholipase A2 and sequentially inhibits the release of arachidonic acid, thereby depressing the formation, release, and activity of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators. Lidocaine Hydrochloride is a topical local anesthetic which helps to reduce pain and stinging in the ear.",

There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves.

During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks. It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides. The effectiveness of Xetril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Xetril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.",
    "pharmacology": "Clonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux. There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.",

Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours.

The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

This ear drop has been specially formulated to maintain the natural environment of the external ear canal. Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that has a broad spectrum of activity against otic pathogens without ototoxicity. Hence Ofloxacin is preferred to Aminoglycosides for any application within the middle ear space. Ofloxacin exerts antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase of bacteria. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against the following organisms responsible for otic infections: Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clotrimazole is a synthetic imidazole derivative, which is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that exerts fungicidal activity against fungi responsible for superficial mycotic infections affecting the outer or middle ear including Candida, Microsporum & Trichophyton. Clotrimazole inhibits Cytochrome P-450 synthesis of Ergosterol, which decreases fungal cell wall integrity thus inhibits fungal growth. Clotrimazole also has activity against certain bacteria such as Streptococci and Staphylococci. The antibacterial effect of Clotrimazole is advantageous to treat mixed bacterial-fungal infections. Beclomethasone Dipropionate is a potent steroid as compared with other topical corticosteroids. Beclomethasone like other topical corticosteroids, has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. It induces phospholipase A2 and sequentially inhibits the release of arachidonic acid, thereby depressing the formation, release, and activity of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators.

Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol produces hypnosis rapidly with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of an injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors.",
    "dosage": {
      "": [
        "Adults: The dosage of Propofol should be titrated individually against the response of the patient. The ordinary initial dosage in adults is 40 mg (4 ml) by slow intravenous bolus injection at intervals of 10 seconds until the clinical signs show the onset of anaesthesia. The ordinary induction dose in healthy patient below 55 years of age is 2.2-2.5 mg/kg. A dose of 1.0-1.5 mg/kg is often sufficient for older patient. Lower doses, most often 20 mg (2 ml) at intervals of 10 seconds, are recommended for patient of ASA grades 3 and 4."

    "sideEffects": "Hypotension and transient apnea may occur at the induction of anaesthesia, and may be severe especially in patients who are in a poor general condition. Epileptic movement, convulsions and dystonic reactions have been seen in rare cases. Pulmonary oedema has also been reported. Headache, nausea and, more rarely, vomiting may occur in some patients during recovery. Recovery may also be associated with another short period of impaired consciousness. Hypersensitivity has been reported in some cases, connected with anaphylactic symptoms such as marked hypotension, bronchospasm, oedema and facial erythema. Some cases of cardiac arrest have occurred in connection with the administration of Propofol. In connection with long-term administration of Propofol, green or reddish brown discolouration of urine may occur. This is caused by the quinol metabolites of Propofol, and is not dangerous. As with other anaesthetics, altered sexual behaviour may occur.",
    "pregnancy_lactation": "Due to insufficient experience, propofol shall not be used during pregnancy. Propofol is rapidly distributed to the foetus and shall therefore not be used for obstetric anaesthesia. Safety to the neonate has not been established in cases, where propofol has been administered to lactating women.",
    "storageConditions": "Propofol should be stored at a temperature not exceeding 25Âº C. It must not be frozen. Any unused solution shall be discarded."

Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.",
    "pregnancy_lactation": "From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy.

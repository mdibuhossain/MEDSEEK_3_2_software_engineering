There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves.

The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate.

    "indications": "It is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks. It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides. The effectiveness of Xetril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Xetril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.",
    "pharmacology": "Clonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux. There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.",

Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues.

Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus.

    "pharmacology": "Mupirocin is a naturally occurring antibiotic. It is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is active against a wide range of bacteria those responsible for the majority of skin infections, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) other staphylococci and streptococci. It is also active against certain gram-negative pathogens, like Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specially binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this unique mode of action, Mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant pathogens is generally eight-fold to thirty-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

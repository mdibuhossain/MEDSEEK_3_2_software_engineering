    "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids.

Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues.

Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus.

It is also active against certain gram-negative pathogens, like Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specially binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this unique mode of action, Mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant pathogens is generally eight-fold to thirty-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Mupirocin is a naturally occurring antibiotic. This antibacterial agent is produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is active against a wide range of bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains and Streptococcus pyogenes) those responsible for the majority of skin infections. It is also active against gram-negative pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.

    "dosage": {
      "ointment": "A small amount of Bactropen ointment should be applied to the affected area 3 times daily for up to 10 days. The safety and effectiveness of Mupirocin ointment have been established in the age range of 2 months to 16 years. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Mupirocin have been established in the age range of 2 months to 16 years. Use of the ointment in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Mupirocin in impetigo in pediatric patients."
    },
    "sideEffects": "Reported side effects are burning, stinging or pain, itching and some patient may be suffered rash, nausea, erythema, dry skin, tenderness, swelling, contact dermatitis and increased exudate.",
    "pregnancy_lactation": "Reproduction studies on Mupirocin ointment in animals have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus. As there is no clinical experience on it’s use during pregnancy, Mupirocin ointment should only be used in pregnancy when the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks of treatment. It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Mupirocin ointment is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "storageConditions": "Keep below 25° C temperature, protected from light and moisture. Do not keep in freeze. Keep out of the reach of children."

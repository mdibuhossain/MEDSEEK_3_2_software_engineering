There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves.

The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks. It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides. The effectiveness of Xetril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Xetril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.",
    "pharmacology": "Clonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux. There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.",
